Unfortunately, I don't know Go, so I wrote in Javascript using a small Express server. Admittedly, I'm also unfamiliar with Docker, so I did my best!

For memory, I just used a simple object to store the receipts, and UUIDs for the IDs.

## Instructions

1. In the project directory, build docker with 'docker build -t receipt-points-api .'

2. Run docker with 'docker run -p 5000:5000 receipt-points-api'

3. Access it within Postman

Thank you for your time and consideration!
